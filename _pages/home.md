# Introduction

I am a passionate PhD student, currently exploring the exciting realm of deep learning applied to music at [IRCAM](http://www.ircam.fr). My work centers around the captivating intersections of technology and music within the [ACIDS research group](http://acids.ircam.fr) of the [Analysis Synthesis Team]([https://www.stms-lab.fr/team/representations-musicales/](http://anasynth.ircam.fr/home/english)).

In addition to my research, I contribute to education by teaching Ableton and Pure Data for the [ATIAM](http://atiam.ircam.fr) Master.

## Research Focus

My research revolves around the following key areas:

1. **Real-time Neural Audio Synthesis:** Exploring the potentials of deep generative models for real-time audio synthesis, my aim is to create innovative and expressive methods that harmoniously blend human creativity with machine intelligence.

2. **Interactive Musical Instruments with Model Controls:** I am committed to developing interactive musical instruments that incorporate model controls powered by artificial intelligence. This approach empowers musicians to explore novel sonic landscapes, expanding the horizons of musical creativity.

3. **Interface Design & Embedding into Hardware Synthesizers:** My focus lies in user-friendly interface design and seamless integration of technology into hardware synthesizers. This enhances the musician's experience and strengthens the connection between creativity and the musical process.

4. **Reflective Study on AI's Artistic Applications and Interviews with Artists:** Through reflective exploration, I investigate the artistic applications of artificial intelligence in music. Engaging in insightful interviews with talented artists, I seek to understand the impact of technology on artistic expression.

## Passion for Electronic Music

Beyond my academic pursuits, I find my inspiration in the realm of electronic music, constantly exploring new horizons of sound and melody. I believe that true creativity flourishes when shared, and I would be delighted to engage in any collaborative endeavors in my field.
