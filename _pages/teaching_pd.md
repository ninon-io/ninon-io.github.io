## Courses

### Set up - To do before the first session

During this course, you will make sounds (even music?) using Pure Data. It is therefore mandatory to have a **personal computer and headphones**. It is also recommended to have **a mouse** as patching with a trackpad can quickly become tricky. If you don't have some of the equipment mentioned above, don't hesitate to send me an email, I will then bring you additional equipment.

Please, do not forget your headphones !

Furthermore, it would be perfect if you could download PD with the provided link above before our first course. Once the software is installed, open it and go to:

- Step 1: Media > Test Audio and MIDI...

In the opened window, at the top left there is a small patch "test tones", click on the square associated to 60 or 80. If you have sound: all good, the manipulation is finished.

If not, go to

- Step 2: Media > Audio Settings

Check that your sample rate is 44100 and increase the delay to 80msec.
Repeat step 1.

If you have time and if you wish, you can have a look on those website which will give you a very decent intuition about:
- [sound synthesis](https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/)
- [synthesizers](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/get-started) 

### Basic Notions

The first course aims at introducing the basic concept of **PD**, while giving the essential elements to build your first synthesizer. A particular attention is given for patch clarity and simplicity. You can find:
- basic notions to begin
- presentation of oscillators
- additive synthesis
- filters
- amplifiers
- keyboard control
- subpatches

### Advanced Notions

The second course presents deeper technics to build more complicated patches and get new sounds. You can find:
- technics to normalize the signal
- ring modulation
- amplitude modulation
- the frequency modulation
- building a step sequencer
- read a soundfile
- building of a kick drum with presets
- courses about externals (given by P. Esling)

## Project

The goal of this assignment is to compose an entire track _**only using Pure Data**_. It must last less than 15 minutes and has no restriction regarding the genre.

You must provide a .wav or .mp3 of your creation alongside with all the patches and samples you used to make it. You can attach a README.txt if necessary.

No post-processing, mixing or mastering are allowed unless you attach a README.txt explaining your method and why you felt the need to do that. A raw track must be provided as well.

No Max MSP allowed but any creative experiment will be valued.

## Externals

Moreover, you can find the usefull litterature to build your own externals for Pd:
