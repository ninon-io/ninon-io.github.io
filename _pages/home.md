# Introduction

I am a PhD student and Research Engineer deeply engaged in advancing the field of deep learning within music. My academic research is conducted at [IRCAM](http://www.ircam.fr) where I am part of the [ACIDS research group](http://acids.ircam.fr) under the [Analysis Synthesis Team](http://anasynth.ircam.fr/home/english). Learn more about my work [here](https://ninon-io.github.io/research).

Alongside my research, I teach courses on [Ableton](https://ninon-io.github.io/teaching/ableton) and [Pure Data](https://ninon-io.github.io/teaching/puredata/) for the [ATIAM](http://atiam.ircam.fr) Master's program. You can explore some of the innovative projects by my students on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/atiam-ircam/sets).

Additionally, I have taken on the role of Research Engineer at [Native Instruments](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/) within the Audio Research Team, focusing on applying deep learning techniques to develop cutting-edge music technology solutions.

## Research Focus

My research revolves around the following key areas:

1. **Real-time Neural Audio Synthesis:** Exploring the potentials of deep generative models for real-time audio synthesis, my aim is to create innovative and expressive methods that harmoniously blend human creativity with deep generation.

2. **Interactive Musical Instruments with Model Controls:** I am committed to developing interactive musical instruments that incorporate model controls powered by artificial intelligence. This approach empowers musicians to explore novel sonic landscapes, expanding the horizons of musical creativity.

3. **Interface Design & Embedding into Hardware Synthesizers:** My focus lies in user-friendly interface design and seamless integration of technology into hardware synthesizers. This enhances the musician's experience and strengthens the musical process.

4. **Reflective Study on AI's Artistic Applications and Interviews with Artists:** Through reflective exploration, I investigate the artistic applications of artificial intelligence in music. Engaging in insightful interviews with talented artists, I seek to understand the impact of technology on artistic expression.
