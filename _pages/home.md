Welcome! I'm **Ninon Devis**, working at the intersection of academic research and industry innovation in **deep learning applied to music**.

My work explores new possibilities for musical expression and interaction through AI-driven tools and real-time systems.

## Core Activities

- **PhD Research @ [IRCAM](http://www.ircam.fr):**  
  Member of the [ACIDS research group](http://acids.ircam.fr) (within the [Analysis Synthesis Team](http://anasynth.ircam.fr/home/english)). My research focuses on neural audio synthesis and model-driven instruments.

- **Research Engineering @ [Native Instruments](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/):**  
  Applying deep learning to sound technology within the Audio Research Team.

- **Teaching @ [ATIAM](http://atiam.ircam.fr) / UPMC:**  
  Courses on [Ableton](/teaching/ableton/) and [Pure Data](/teaching/puredata/).  
  → Hear student projects on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/atiam-ircam/sets)

## Research Interests

1. **Real-time Neural Audio Synthesis**  
   Deep generative models for responsive, expressive sound generation.

2. **AI-Controlled Instruments**  
   Instruments where musicians modulate latent space or descriptors.

3. **Interface & Hardware Integration**  
   Embedding intelligent systems directly into modular and hardware setups.

4. **AI's Artistic Role**  
   Investigating the aesthetic and societal implications of AI in music creation.

## Beyond Research

I also create electronic music influenced by deep techno and modular synthesis. I believe in the power of shared creativity and am always open to collaborations—artistic, academic, or hybrid.
