## The Dialogue: Art, Research, and Innovation

**I work at the crossroads of industrial techno, experimental music, and generative art, pioneering new forms of musical expression through deep learning.**

My practice is a dynamic dialogue: sound is a physical force, sculpted through machines and algorithms, while my research explores how creative AI can unlock new worlds of sonic expression while preserving the singularity of the artist's touch.

## Core Focus

I apply advanced **deep learning to music** to create innovative tools and real-time systems.

| **Academic Research** | **Industry Innovation** | **Artistic Practice** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PhD Research @ [IRCAM](http://www.ircam.fr)**, ACIDS Group. Focus on neural audio synthesis and model-driven instruments, including the **Neurorack** project. | **Research Engineering @ [Native Instruments](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/)**, Audio Research Team. Applying deep learning to next-generation sound technology. | **Producer & Sound Artist**. Creating electronic music influenced by cinematic deep techno and modular synthesis. |

## Research & Projects

### Current Interests

I am dedicated to making AI a tangible, expressive partner for musicians. My research explores:

1.  **Real-time Neural Audio Synthesis:** Creating deep generative models for responsive and expressive sound generation.
2.  **AI-Controlled Instruments:** Developing new interfaces where musicians modulate latent space or high-level descriptors.
3.  **Interface & Hardware Integration:** Embedding intelligent systems directly into modular and professional hardware setups.
4.  **AI's Artistic Role:** Investigating the aesthetic and societal implications of AI in music creation.

## Teaching & Education

As a Lecturer, I share my passion for sonic creativity and technology:

* **[ATIAM](http://atiam.ircam.fr):** Courses on **[Ableton](/teaching/ableton/)** and **[Pure Data](/teaching/puredata/)** at IRCAM / Sorbonne Université.
* → Hear student work on **[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/atiam-ircam/sets)**.
