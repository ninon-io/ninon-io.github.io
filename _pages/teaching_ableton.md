## Project

### The artistic theme of this year is: _**Time**_

The goal of this assignment is to compose an entire track using _**Ableton**_. It must last less than 15 minutes and has no restriction regarding the genre.

You must provide a .wav of your creation alongside with the ableton project and all the samples you used to make it. You should attach a README.txt if you want to introduce your artisctic intention.

Any creative experiment will be valued.
