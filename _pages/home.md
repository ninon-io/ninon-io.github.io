## Art, Research, and Innovation

**I work at the crossroads of techno, experimental music, and generative art, pioneering new forms of musical expression through deep learning.**

My practice is a dynamic dialogue: sound is a physical force, sculpted through machines and algorithms, while my research explores how creative AI can unlock new worlds of sonic expression while preserving the singularity of the artist's touch.

## Core Focus

I apply advanced **deep learning to music** to create innovative tools and real-time systems across three core domains:

* ### Industry Innovation
    **Research Engineering @ [Native Instruments](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/)**, Audio Research Team. I am dedicated to applying deep learning to next-generation sound technology and developing innovative product features.

* ### Artistic Practice
    **Producer & Sound Artist**. I create electronic music influenced by **cinematic deep techno** and **modular synthesis**.

  * ### Academic Research
    **PhD Doctorate @ [IRCAM](http://www.ircam.fr)**, ACIDS Group. My focus is on **neural audio synthesis** and **model-driven instruments**, including the creation of the **Neurorack**—the first Eurorack modular synthesizer powered by deep neural synthesis.

## Research & Projects

### Current Interests

I am dedicated to making AI a tangible, expressive partner for musicians. My research explores:

1.  **Real-time Neural Audio Synthesis:** Creating deep generative models for responsive and expressive sound generation.
2.  **AI-Controlled Instruments:** Developing new interfaces where musicians modulate latent space or high-level descriptors.
3.  **Interface & Hardware Integration:** Embedding intelligent systems directly into modular and professional hardware setups.
4.  **AI's Artistic Role:** Investigating the aesthetic and societal implications of AI in music creation.

## Teaching & Education

* **[ATIAM](http://atiam.ircam.fr):** Courses on **[Ableton](/teaching/ableton/)** and **[Pure Data](/teaching/puredata/)** at IRCAM / Sorbonne Université.
* → Hear student work on **[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/atiam-ircam/sets)**.
