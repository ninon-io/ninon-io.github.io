# Introduction

I am a PhD student and Research Engineer exploring the creative potential of **deep learning in music**.

At [IRCAM](http://www.ircam.fr), I conduct research within the [ACIDS](http://acids.ircam.fr) group of the [Analysis-Synthesis Team](http://anasynth.ircam.fr/home/english).  
I also work at [Native Instruments](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/) as a Research Engineer, building forward-thinking audio tools with neural networks.

I teach [Ableton Live](https://ninon-io.github.io/teaching/ableton) and [Pure Data](https://ninon-io.github.io/teaching/puredata/) in the [ATIAM](http://atiam.ircam.fr) Master's program, and curate student projects on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/atiam-ircam/sets).

## Research Focus

1. **Real-time Neural Audio Synthesis**  
   Generative models for expressive, low-latency sound synthesis.

2. **Interactive Model-Controlled Instruments**  
   Bridging modular thinking with AI-powered sound engines.

3. **Hardware & Interface Design**  
   Embedding deep models into tactile, performance-ready instruments.

4. **Artistic Research & Interviews**  
   Exploring how artists appropriate and reframe AI through reflective practice.

## Electronic Music

My creative work lies at the intersection of **deep sound design** and **modular techno**. I’m always open to collaboration — whether artistic, pedagogical, or research-driven.
