Welcome! I'm Ninon Devis, working at the intersection of academic research and industry innovation in **deep learning applied to music**.

My goal is to explore and create new possibilities for musical expression and interaction through technology.

### Core Activities

* **PhD Research @ [IRCAM](http://www.ircam.fr):** Within the [ACIDS research group](http://acids.ircam.fr) ([Analysis Synthesis Team](http://anasynth.ircam.fr/home/english)), focusing on real-time neural audio synthesis and interactive AI-powered instruments. Explore my [**Research Projects**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/research.md %}).
* **Research Engineering @ [Native Instruments](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/):** Applying deep learning techniques within the Audio Research Team to develop next-generation music technology solutions.
* **Teaching @ [ATIAM](http://atiam.ircam.fr) / UPMC:** Instructing Master's students in [Ableton]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/teaching/ableton.md %}) and [Pure Data]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/teaching/puredata.md %}). Hear student projects on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/atiam-ircam/sets).

## Research Interests

My research centers on enhancing musical creativity by merging human artistry with intelligent systems:

1.  **Real-time Neural Audio Synthesis:** Developing expressive, real-time deep generative models for audio synthesis that respond intuitively to human interaction.
2.  **Interactive AI Instruments:** Creating novel musical instruments where AI model controls empower musicians to explore unique sonic territories.
3.  **Interface & Hardware Integration:** Designing user-friendly interfaces and embedding advanced synthesis models seamlessly into hardware for an improved creative workflow.
4.  **AI's Artistic Role:** Reflecting on the artistic applications of AI in music, informed by discussions and interviews with artists navigating this evolving landscape.

## Explore Further

Dive deeper into my work through these sections:

* [**Publications & Presentations**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/publications.md %})
* [**Detailed Project Descriptions**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/projects.md %})
* [**Teaching Materials**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/teaching.md %})

## Beyond Research

Outside of my technical work, I'm passionate about **electronic music creation**. I believe strongly in the power of shared creativity and welcome opportunities for collaboration in related fields.
