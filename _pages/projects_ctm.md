## Ninon & Jun Suzuki x Wilding AI Lab

We were thrilled to share our first collaboration with and **Jun Suzuki** ([@einleit](https://www.instagram.com/einleit/)) – which kicked off as part of the **Wilding AI Lab** in January 2025.

Selected alongside nine other talented artists, we joined this unique workshop-residency exploring the creative frontiers of AI systems involving text, audio, and sound spatialization. The lab was guided by facilitators Beth Coleman, Maurice Jones, Portrait XO, and Alexandre Saunier.

## About the Wilding AI Initiative

Initially launched at [MUTEK Festival Montréal](https://montreal.mutek.org/) ([@mutekmontreal](https://www.instagram.com/mutekmontreal/)) in August 2024 and continuing experiments at MUTEK.MX, **Wilding AI** presents an open space to "reopen the black boxes of generative AI."

Spearheaded by artists and researchers the initiative gathers participants to encounter manifold artistic and technological experiments, interventions, and provocations. It follows Beth Coleman’s appeal for imagining an AI »that can be free—if not to imagine, then to generate—speeding through possibilities, junctures that are idiotic until they are not.« The goal is to explore and materially manifest "wild AI futures."

## The Lab @ MONOM / 4DSOUND (CTM Festival 2025)

For its Berlin iteration ahead of [CTM Festival 2025](https://www.ctm-festival.de/) ([@ctmfestival](https://www.instagram.com/ctmfestival/)), the Wilding AI Lab landed in the unique environment of [MONOM, Berlin's Centre for Spatial Sound](https://monom.studios/) ([@monomstudios](https://www.instagram.com/monomstudios/)).

### MONOM & The 4DSOUND System

[MONOM](https://monom.studios/) is an artistic studio working at the intersection of spatial sound, music, art, and technology. It is home to the original **[4DSOUND](https://4dsound.net/)** system ([@4dsound](https://www.instagram.com/4dsound/)), an advanced spatial sound instrument capable of projecting sound holograms. Sounds are designed not just to be heard, but felt, appearing in space as entities with tangible physical presence, depth, and dimensionality, moving beyond traditional speaker perception. 4DSOUND provides an intuitive control platform for artists to experiment with spatial attributes, design virtual sonic worlds, and sculpt interactions within them, fostering embodied listening experiences.

### Lab Structure & Our Exploration

The intensive four-day lab (Jan 23-26, 2025) combined morning skill-sharing workshops (open to the public) with afternoon hands-on experimentation sessions for the selected artists.
* **Day 1 (Word):** Storytelling, world-building, critical LLM use (Beth Coleman, Maurice Jones).
* **Day 2 (Sound):** Generative sound tools, data sonification (Portrait XO).
* **Day 3 (Space):** AI-driven sound spatialization in the 4DSOUND environment (Alexandre Saunier).
* **Day 4 (Open Lab):** Public presentation of prototypes and processes.

## Open Lab Presentation

The residency culminated in the **Wilding AI Open Lab** on Sunday, January 26th (13:00–17:00), where all participating artists shared processes, prototypes, and artistic interventions developed during the week.
