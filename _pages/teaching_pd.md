## Courses

### Basic Notions

The first course aims at introducing the basic concept of **PD**, while giving the essential elements to build your first synthesizer. A particular attention is given for patch clarity and simplicity. You can find:
- basic notions to begin
- presentation of oscillators
- additive synthesis
- filters
- amplifiers
- keyboard control
- subpatches

### Advanced Notions

The second course presents deeper technics to build more complicated patches and get new sounds. You can find:
- technics to normalize the signal
- ring modulation
- amplitude modulation
- the frequency modulation
- building a step sequencer
- read a soundfile
- building of a kick drum with presets
- courses about externals (given by P. Esling)

## Project

The goal of this assignment is to compose an entire track _**only using Pure Data**_. It must last less than 15 minutes and has no restriction regarding the genre.

You must provide a .wav or .mp3 of your creation alongside with all the patches and samples you used to make it. You can attach a README.txt if necessary.

No post-processing, mixing or mastering are allowed unless you attach a README.txt explaining your method and why you felt the need to do that. A raw track must be provided as well.

No Max MSP allowed but any creative experiment will be valued.
